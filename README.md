# SpringDataJPA-Querydsl

Querydsl is an extensive Java framework, which helps with creating and running type-safe queries in a domain specific language that is similar to SQL. It is an alternative to both JPQL and Criteria queries and it combines the dynamic nature of Criteria queries with the expressiveness of JPQL and all that in a fully typesafe manner.
